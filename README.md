### Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"\
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

### Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
